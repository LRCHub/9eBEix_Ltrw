```lrc
[00:00.86] The way I go through with red roses burn my eyes
[00:13.81] Cold rain starts pouring hard, I'm being called upon
[00:24.46] Never let you go, it's why I did them all
[00:32.38] For a chance at least, to live in your way
[00:39.26] Love of you is my most cherished thing
[00:45.75] So stay alive, bravely
[00:56.64] Ahhh
[01:02.64] Ahhh
[01:19.10] I wish I could wake from the dream each time I dream
[01:31.98] There's a long night coming soon, I'd shine as the last shine
[02:02.48] 
[01:42.54] Never let you go, it's why I did them all
[01:49.69] For a chance at least, to live in your way
[01:57.03] Love of you is my most cherished thing
[02:03.58] So stay alive, bravely
[02:14.58] 
[02:21.71] Never let you go, It's why I did them all
[02:28.96] For a chance at least, to live in your way
[02:35.75] Love of you is my most cherished thing
[02:42.36] So stay alive, bravely
